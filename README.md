# Power_stabilization_HWP
Arduino code for a laser power stabilization using a HWP with a Newport CONEX-AG-PR100P and a PBZ. The laserpower is measured either with a photoabsorptive Coherent powermeter or a Melles-Griot thermal powermeter, which both output a 0-1V analog signal.
As the program with the Coherent powermeter works better, the program is more advanced and up-to-date.
